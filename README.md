# Aerospace-Industry-Space-Flights-Failure-Analysis

Throughout history, many manned and unmanned space flights have failed due to many known and unknown reasons tragically taking the lives of hundreds around the world. These failure have costed companies millions of dollars. It is crucial to understand the reasons and factors contributing to these accidents in order to better prepare for them and try to prevent them from happening again. These are useful for defence, aerospace and commercial flight missions including SpaceX, Boeing, etc. 

The dataset is combined from SpaceX Missions from 2006-Present, Space Flights from companies such as Boeing, US Air Force, European Space Agency, Brazilian Space Agency and Arianespace. It also has weather conditions such as wind speed, temperature, humidity along with the date of the departure/launch of the mission acquired from the Weather History Reports. 

The dataset is then fit to predictive models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbour with highest accuracy being 93.3% of both Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbour.
